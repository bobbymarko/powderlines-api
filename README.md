Powderlines SNOTEL API
===============

Documentation for the API is here: http://powderlin.es/api.html

NodeJS port of server is here: https://github.com/dpk5e7/powderlines-js

TODO:

* Add additional data sources. We could use snow data from avalanche centers. For instance here is the data for Washington from NWAC: http://data.nwac.us/ALL.
* Debug why errors are returned so frequently (might be too few dynos on heroku)
* Update list of stations to include new SNOTEL stations. Is there a better way to get this data than manually adding it?
* Create an endpoint for finding stations with deepest snow packs
* Add avalanche data to each station (NWAC has API for Washington www.nwac.us/api/v2/)
